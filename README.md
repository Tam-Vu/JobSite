<h2 id="structure">üìÇ Folder Structure</h2>

- Api
  - Is where endpoints are located. 
  - receives input data and passes commands or queries down to the `application` layer. 
- Contract:
  - Holds the input data within a request body. This data, along with parameters or query parameters, is formatted to comply with the input data requirements of the application layer.
  - Invoked by the `Api` layer.
- Application:
  - Common is a place to store configurations for validation, authorization, and logging actions. It also contains security interface (jwt service, identity,...), exceptions, mapping configurations, and return result definitions,...
  - Each entity is divided into 3 folders:
    - Commands folder: Contains 3 files: Command (specifies input data), Handler (processes logic), and Validator (validates input data).
    - Queries folder: Contains 3 files: Query (specifies input data), Handler (processes logic), and Response (defines output data).
    - Common folder: Contains commonly used data such as mappers for entities with input and output data.
  - IRepository folder: Declares interfaces that will be defined in the Infrastructure layer
  - Call the `Infrastructure` layer during data processing.
  - Called by `Api` folder.
- Infrastructure:
  - Common: 
	  - Is the place where common Interface defined.
	  - Contains application database context and database initialized.
  - Each entity has:
	- Configuration: file to define the relationship between two entities.
	- Repository: to define interface in the Irepository folder in Application layer.
	- Background Service(optional): to define background service for specific entities.
  - EntityFrameworkCore: contains interceptors and imgrations.
  - Called by `Application` layer.
- Domain:
  - Represents data structures used within the system.
  -  Can be called by the `Infrastructure` layer.
